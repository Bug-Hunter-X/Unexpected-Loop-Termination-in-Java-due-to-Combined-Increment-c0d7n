This repository demonstrates a subtle Java code error related to loop control and variable increment. The provided code has an `if` condition within a `while` loop that contains an increment of the loop counter variable which can lead to unexpected loop termination.  The solution file demonstrates a cleaner and more readable approach to handle the increment and ensure the intended loop behavior.
